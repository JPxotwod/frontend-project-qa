# frontend-project-qa


This is my second individual project for QA.
This README.md file will focus just on the front-end of the project.

Here you will find a link to my Jira board: https://josephp123.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/QSP/boards/4/backlog
Here you will find the link to repository on GitHub: https://github.com/JPxotwod/frontend-project-qa
ALL DOCUMENTATION AND SO ON WILL BE FOUND IN THE BACK-END REPO.

Project Brief:

The purpose of this document is to outline the individual project specification that you will be working on during the training. This project will involve concepts from all core training modules; more specifically, this will involve:

Agile & Project Management,
Databases & Cloud Fundamentals,
Java SE/EE,
Front-End Development,
Automated Testing.

The individual project can be on any subject you deem fit of encapsulating all aspects of the aforementioned modules. This could be a business case, such as a library or supermarket system, or something to do with a hobby of yours â€“ as long as the application is CRUD functional.

This is purposefully open as we want to endorse creativity and give you an opportunity to do a project that you have full command over.

Your front-end and back-end must be linked together and fully functional, please bear this in mind when organising your time.

Introduction:

The aim and objective of this project was to create a CRUD application that encapsulated all of the core modules covered over the last 9 weeks.
We were given a project specification that contained a variety of user requirements and targets that we had to meet.

Project Management - a fully expanded, up-to-date and relevant Jira board, clear documentation for designs, risk assessments etc. and code integrated into a version control system.

Databases - a relational database to store persistent data from the project.

Java SE and Spring Boot - a functional application, containing a CRUD controller, created in OOP language which meets specification requirements and is in line with Kanban.

Testing - Appropriate levels of test coverage on back-end using JUnit, MockMVC and Mockito.

Front-End Development - Functioning front-end website with API integration (details will be within another README.md).


Planning Resources:

Like the Back-End README.md, I explained that throughout the project, I utilised Jira, thus I created a Kanban Board and Roadmap modelled as a SCRUM aswell as creating User Stories and Epics in order to help break down and organise the project into smaller and more manageable objectives.
Within the User Stories, I created linked child issues for the front and back-end of my project to help the structure of the build. In total I have 4 Epics, all with multiple User Stories. An example will be shown within my presentation which you will also be able to find within this repository.
Throughout the project I completed various sprints, with issues being grouped into different sections, often based on priority or requirements.


Git and GitHub:

Using Git throughout the project meant that I was able to save code regularly on their relevant branches, utilising the method of version source control.
This meant that my work was frequently backed up, in case of any potential problems.
For my project, I set up two Git repositories: one for front-end and one for back-end. Screenshots containing the Network Graph for each repository will also be found in the presentation.
*Presentation will be found in the back-end repository*


Front-End:

The front-end of my project was built via the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used HTML to create the front-end, including the layout which consisted of forms, numerous buttons, headings and so on.

I then ustilised CSS to edit the look of the website. This included colour scheme, positioning, padding, spacing etc and included any cool buttons or text boxes where needed.

I then used JaveScript for API integration and to create multiple functions that were used throughout the website, such as pop-ups or the ability to show/hide requested data.
